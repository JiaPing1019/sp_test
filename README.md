# sp_test

## Introduction

This is a tech test for [Smart pension](https://www.smartpension.co.uk/), writing a script that can receive a log as argument in Ruby. Apart from Ruby, the only technology used is the [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) to test our code work properly.

## Quickstart

- Clone/download the repository

- Move to ruby_app directory
```
 cd ruby_app
```

- Install the dependencies specified in the Gemfile
```
bundle install
```

- Run the ruby script to check the result of the most page views, and most unique page views lists
```
bundle exec ruby script/log_report_script.rb webserver.log
```

- Run the tests in RSpec
```
bundle exec rspec   ## runs the entire test suite
```

- Check the test result without running any command
```
Take a look at spec/examples.txt
```
